# liri
An interactive API search program using node.js. The application will search from 3 apis and using an npm package called axios, will access and pull information based on the users search request. The application will work in the following way: 1. The user enters a search in the terminal in one of the following ways: a. spotify-this-song b. concert-this c. movie-this d. do-what-it-says 2. after choosing a command and attaching it to a request (ex: spotify-this-song thriller), the command line will return the requested result. 3. If it is a command outside of the scope of "liri", it will return "Liri does not know that!!"

This was a program using apis which I have used before, but now returning outside the browser using Node and node packages like axios, moment, and dotenv. I also used a datakeys file on this to hide keys and passcodes. I was the sole contributor as part of a weekly homework assignment.

here are images of working search queries from the command line:
